THE AUTOMOTIVE DOMAIN: A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY DOCUMENT
1. Introduction to Automobiles

An automobile, commonly referred to as a car, is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most modern cars are powered by internal combustion engines or electric motors. The evolution of the automobile transformed global transportation, industry, urban planning, and economics.

Cars consist of several core subsystems:

Powertrain

Chassis

Suspension

Braking system

Electrical system

Infotainment system

Safety systems

The development of automobiles has been shaped by engineering innovation, environmental regulations, consumer demand, and advancements in materials science.

2. Historical Evolution of Cars
2.1 Early Development

The first practical automobile is often credited to Karl Benz, who developed the Benz Patent-Motorwagen in 1885. This vehicle used a gasoline-powered internal combustion engine.

At the same time, Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach were also developing early motor vehicles in Germany.

2.2 Mass Production Era

The automotive industry experienced a revolution when Henry Ford introduced assembly line manufacturing for the Ford Model T. This dramatically reduced production costs and made cars accessible to the middle class.
